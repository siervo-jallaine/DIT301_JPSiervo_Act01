**REFLECTION**

**1. What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?**

  The installation was harder than I thought it would be. It's a really big program,
  so the download took a very long time. The most difficult part was trying to get the 
  virtual phone to work; it kept giving me an error. 


**2. What did you learn about Android app structure?**

  I was surprised by how many files and folders there are for just one simple app. 
The main thing I learned is that the code that makes the app work is kept in a different
place from what the app actually looks like. There's a java folder for the programming part, 
and then a res folder that has the screen design and the text.
